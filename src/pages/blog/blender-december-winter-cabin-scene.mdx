Last December I thought it would be fun to try and learn 3D modelling using Blender. I started with BlenderGuru's [donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U). I completed it which felt great, and it was an enjoyable experience, but then it came time to actually make things without following an entire tutorial, I tried bits and pieces but eventually I gave up as Blender is actually quite difficult but I expected to be creating things that looked as good as the donut from the get go.

**My finished donut**

A year goes by and because I spent last Christmas working on the donut, I have associated Blender with feeling festive and so I felt like giving it another shot. Instead of following entire tutorials I am setting a goal each month to finish a project ideally with a theme that fits the month (so festive/cosy this time round). My goal is to have something to show, even if it's small and definitely if it isn't perfect (as I need to keep in mind that I'll be in [The Gap](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/n2jfot/keep_going/) for a long time).

I aim to publish a little blogpost at the end of each month with images of the final render + any experiments, I might occasionally write about the project if there was anything particularly interesting but most of the time it'll just be the final renders.

To cut a long story short, here's the renders for this month's project:

## The renders

**The final render, without any effects applied**

It is surrounded by various items such as wooden barrels and a pile of logs, all covered in a thick blanket of snow. There are two trees to the left of the cabin, also covered in a thick blanket of snow.](/assets/blog/blender-december-winter-cabin-scene/winter_cabin_scene_final.png)

**A pixelated effect achieved using compositor nodes**

There are two trees to the left of the cabin, also covered in a thick blanket of snow. The image has an effect applied over-top which makes it look as if it were drawn in the style of pixel art.](/assets/blog/blender-december-winter-cabin-scene/winter_cabin_scene_final--pixelated.png)

I personally prefer this version, mainly because it hides rough edges. I found the nodes on Twitter somewhere but I can't actually remember where, I'll probably try and learn how it all works properly so that I can write a short guide, mainly for my own learning...The nodes I used to achieve this:

**Clay render**

It is surrounded by various items such as wooden barrels and a pile of logs, all covered in a thick blanket of snow. There are two trees to the left of the cabin, also covered in a thick blanket of snow. The image is shown as a clay render, without any textures or materials applied.](/assets/blog/blender-december-winter-cabin-scene/winter_cabin_scene_final--clay.png)

**An initial version**

I originally went for a daytime vibe and used an isometric camera but didn't like the results, this was the only early progress screenshot I took.

## Resources

I used a few of different resources for individual parts but not an entire tutorial. The main ones were:

- [Procedural snow material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzJnsqIRbDw) for the snow
- [Low poly christmas tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5fUeZQe_JU) for the trees
- [Quick smoke sim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtKQwN9P0sE) for the smoke coming out of the chimney
