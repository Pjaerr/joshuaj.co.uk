On the 25th of March 2019 I sat down and laid out the goals I would like to have achieved in 12 months time; One of those goals was to read more books and to do that I set an achieveable target of 10 books, although for someone who has only read around 2 books in the previous 20 years it was a relatively high target.

I sucessfully achieved my goal on the 29th of January 2020; The following post showcases some stats and then each book that I read and when I read it. This is more of a document for myself to look back at and be proud of sucessfully forming a reading habit but was also written as a way for me to try out using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) in my blogposts.

## Statistics

- The average number of pages each book had was **342**
- I read **6** **Self-Help** books
- I read **3** **History** books
- I read **1** **Science** book
- My average rating was **3.75/5**
- It took me an average of **26 days** to finish a book
- The longest it took me to finish a book was **34 days**
- The shortest it took me to finish a book was **15 Days**

  description="In Deep Work, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits.

## Conclusion

Since starting in March of last year, I have finished the 10 books listed above, and I am over half way through 3 more books: **When** by Daniel H. Pink, **A Short History of Nearly Everything** by Bill Bryson and **Hitler's Forgotten Children** by Ingrid Von Oelhafen.

I have also formed a reading habit that is now a vital part of my morning routine. I believe the things that helped the most was setting a realistic goal, choosing books that I actually like the sound of (not just popular books) and forcing myself to read every morning. It really is that simple.
