# joshuaj.co.uk (Personal site)
The repository for my personal site and blog. The `gh-pages` branch is the version of the [site](https://www.joshuaj.co.uk) that is live right now but it might not be the same code that is in `master` (when in doubt, see when the branches were last updated)


I've recently rebuilt this site in [Astro.js](https://astro.build/), here are links to previous versions:

* **2020** - https://github.com/Pjaerr/joshuaj.co.uk/tree/2020-rebuild
Rebuilt, again, but still in Gatsby with a fresher design and utilising mdx to include components in my markdown. Ultimately I let the dependencies get so out of date on this that I couldn't actually build it! Instead of bashing my head against it I decided to rebuild it in Astro.js.

* **2019** - https://github.com/Pjaerr/joshuaj.co.uk/tree/old-gatsby-2019
Initial stab at using Gatsby, I think with the same old design as the previous iteration, this one didn't stick around too long.

* **2018-2019** - https://github.com/Pjaerr/joshuaj.co.uk/tree/2019-non-gatsby
I didn't use any framework for this version, I still wrote in basic markdown and then manually parsed it and included syntax highlighting, was a good way to learn but I definitely benefitted from switching to a more established framework.
